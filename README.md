## Introduction

We are excited to announce the release of Qwen3, the latest addition to the Qwen family of large language models.
These models represent our most advanced and intelligent systems to date, improving from our experience in building QwQ and Qwen2.5.
We are making the weights of Qwen3 available to the public, including both dense and Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) models. 

The highlights from Qwen3 include:
- **Dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models of various sizes**, available in 0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B, 14B, 32B and 30B-A3B, 235B-A22B.
- **Seamless switching between thinking mode** (for complex logical reasoning, math, and coding) and **non-thinking mode** (for efficient, general-purpose chat), ensuring optimal performance across various scenarios.
- **Significantly enhancement in reasoning capabilities**, surpassing previous QwQ (in thinking mode) and Qwen2.5 instruct models (in non-thinking mode) on mathematics, code generation, and commonsense logical reasoning.
- **Superior human preference alignment**, excelling in creative writing, role-playing, multi-turn dialogues, and instruction following, to deliver a more natural, engaging, and immersive conversational experience.
- **Expertise in agent capabilities**, enabling precise integration with external tools in both thinking and unthinking modes and achieving leading performance among open-source models in complex agent-based tasks.
- **Support of 100+ languages and dialects** with strong capabilities for **multilingual instruction following** and **translation**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Qwen3 models adopt a different naming scheme.
>
> The post-trained models do not use the "-Instruct" suffix anymore. For example, Qwen3-32B is the newer version of Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct.
>
> The base models now have names ending with "-Base".

For requirements on GPU memory and the respective throughput, see results [here](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/speed_benchmark.html).

## Run Qwen3

### 🤗 Transformers

Transformers is a library of pretrained natural language processing for inference and training. 
The latest version of `transformers` is recommended and `transformers>=4.51.0` is required.

The following contains a code snippet illustrating how to use the model generate content based on given inputs. 
```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
model_name = "Qwen/Qwen3-8B"

# load the tokenizer and the model
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    torch_dtype="auto",
    device_map="auto"
)

# prepare the model input
prompt = "Give me a short introduction to large language models."
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
]
text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize=False,
    add_generation_prompt=True,
    enable_thinking=True # Switches between thinking and non-thinking modes. Default is True.
)
model_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)

# conduct text completion
generated_ids = model.generate(
    **model_inputs,
    max_new_tokens=32768
)
output_ids = generated_ids[0][len(model_inputs.input_ids[0]):].tolist() 

# the result will begin with thinking content in <think></think> tags, followed by the actual response
print(tokenizer.decode(output_ids, skip_special_tokens=True))
```

By default, Qwen3 models will think before response.
This could be controlled by
- `enable_thinking=False`: Passing `enable_thinking=False` to `tokenizer.apply_chat_template` will strictly prevent the model from generating thinking content.
- `/think` and `/nothink` instructions: Use those words in the system or user message to signify whether Qwen3 should think. In multi-turn conversations, the latest instruction is followed.



### ModelScope

We strongly advise users especially those in mainland China to use ModelScope. 
ModelScope adopts a Python API similar to Transformers.
The CLI tool `modelscope download` can help you solve issues concerning downloading checkpoints.


### llama.cpp

[`llama.cpp`](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) enables LLM inference with minimal setup and state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of hardware.
`llama.cpp>=b5092` is required.

To use the CLI, run the following in a terminal:
```shell
./llama-cli -hf Qwen/Qwen3-8B-GGUF:Q8_0 --jinja --color -ngl 99 -fa -sm row --temp 0.6 --top-k 20 --top-p 0.95 --min-p 0 -c 40960 -n 32768 --no-context-shift
# CTRL+C to exit
```

To use the API server, run the following in a terminal:
```shell
./llama-server -hf Qwen/Qwen3-8B-GGUF:Q8_0 --jinja --reasoning-format deepseek -ngl 99 -fa -sm row --temp 0.6 --top-k 20 --top-p 0.95 --min-p 0 -c 40960 -n 32768 --no-context-shift --port 8080
```
A simple web front end will be at `http://localhost:8080` and an OpenAI-compatible API will be at `http://localhost:8080/v1`.

For additional guides, please refer to [our documentation](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/run_locally/llama.cpp.html).

> [!TIP]
> llama.cpp adopts "rotating context management" and infinite generation is made possible by evicting earlier tokens.
> It could configured by parameters and the commands above effectively disable it.
> For more details, please refer to [our documentation](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/run_locally/llama.cpp.html#llama-cli).

### Ollama

After [installing Ollama](https://ollama.com/), you can initiate the Ollama service with the following command (Ollama v0.6.6 or higher is required):
```shell
ollama serve
# You need to keep this service running whenever you are using ollama
```

To pull a model checkpoint and run the model, use the `ollama run` command. You can specify a model size by adding a suffix to `qwen3`, such as `:8b` or `:30b-a3b`:
```shell
ollama run qwen3:8b
# Setting parameters, type "/set parameter num_ctx 40960" and "/set parameter num_predict 32768"
# To exit, type "/bye" and press ENTER
```

You can also access the Ollama service via its OpenAI-compatible API. 
Please note that you need to (1) keep `ollama serve` running while using the API, and (2) execute `ollama run qwen3:8b` before utilizing this API to ensure that the model checkpoint is prepared.
The API is at `http://localhost:11434/v1/` by default.

For additional details, please visit [ollama.ai](https://ollama.com/).

> [!TIP]
> Ollama adopts the same "rotating context management" with llama.cpp.
> However, its default settings (`num_ctx` 2048 and `num_predict` -1), suggesting infinite generation with a 2048-token context,
> could lead to trouble for Qwen3 models.
> We recommend setting `num_ctx` and `num_predict` properly.

### LMStudio

Qwen3 has already been supported by [lmstudio.ai](https://lmstudio.ai/). You can directly use LMStudio with our GGUF files.

### MLX LM

If you are running on Apple Silicon, [`mlx-lm`](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-lm) also supports Qwen3 (`mlx-lm>=0.24.0`). 
Look for models ending with MLX on Hugging Face Hub.


<!-- ### OpenVINO

Qwen2.5 has already been supported by [OpenVINO toolkit](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit). You can install and run this [chatbot example](https://github.com/OpenVINO-dev-contest/Qwen2.openvino) with Intel CPU, integrated GPU or discrete GPU.  -->


<!-- ### Text generation web UI

You can directly use [`text-generation-webui`](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui) for creating a web UI demo. If you use GGUF, remember to install the latest wheel of `llama.cpp` with the support of Qwen2.5. -->


<!-- ### llamafile

Clone [`llamafile`](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile), run source install, and then create your own llamafile with the GGUF file following the guide [here](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile?tab=readme-ov-file#creating-llamafiles). You are able to run one line of command, say `./qwen.llamafile`, to create a demo. -->


## Deploy Qwen3

Qwen3 is supported by multiple inference frameworks. 
Here we demonstrate the usage of `SGLang` and `vLLM`.
You can also find Qwen3 models from various inference providers, e.g., [Alibaba Cloud Model Studio](https://www.alibabacloud.com/en/product/modelstudio).

### SGLang

[SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) is a fast serving framework for large language models and vision language models.
SGLang could be used to launch a server with OpenAI-compatible API service. 
`sglang>=0.4.6.post1` is required.
It is as easy as
```shell
python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-8B --port 30000 --reasoning-parser qwen3
```
An OpenAI-compatible API will be available at `http://localhost:30000/v1`.

### vLLM

[vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) is a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference and serving engine for LLMs.
`vllm>=0.8.5` is recommended.

```shell
vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-8B --port 8000 --enable-reasoning --reasoning-parser deepseek_r1
```
An OpenAI-compatible API will be available at `http://localhost:8000/v1`.

### MindIE

For deployment on Ascend NPUs, please visit [Modelers](https://modelers.cn/) and search for Qwen3.

<!-- 
### OpenLLM

[OpenLLM](https://github.com/bentoml/OpenLLM) allows you to easily run Qwen2.5 as OpenAI-compatible APIs. You can start a model server using `openllm serve`. For example:

```bash
openllm serve qwen2.5:7b
```

The server is active at `http://localhost:3000/`, providing OpenAI-compatible APIs. You can create an OpenAI client to call its chat API. For more information, refer to [our documentation](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment/openllm.html). -->


## Build with Qwen3

### Tool Use

For tool use capabilities, we recommend taking a look at [Qwen-Agent](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Agent), which provides a wrapper around these APIs to support tool use or function calling with MCP support.
Tool use with Qwen3 can also be conducted with SGLang, vLLM, Transformers, llama.cpp, Ollama, etc.
Follow guides in our documentation to see how to enable the support.


### Finetuning

We advise you to use training frameworks, including [Axolotl](https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl), [UnSloth](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth), [Swift](https://github.com/modelscope/swift), [Llama-Factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory), etc., to finetune your models with SFT, DPO, GRPO, etc.
